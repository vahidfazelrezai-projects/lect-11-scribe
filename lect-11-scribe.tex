Today's lecture focused on implementing \textit{public-key encryption}, especially RSA, and \textit{bit-by-bit encryption}. We also discussed techniques for implementing \textit{homomorphic encryption}, which enables some computation to be performed on encrypted data. 

\section{RSA preprocessing}

RSA has many nice properties. For example, every bit of the input is a hard-core bit for the trapdoor function family. But last lecture we also observed some flaws in the plain vanilla RSA encryption scheme:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Revealed information: for example, the Jacobi symbol of the ciphertext is equal to the Jacobi symbol of the message
  \item Determinism: RSA does not involve randomness, so a given message $m$ always encrypts to the same ciphertext $c$. This makes RSA insecure against chosen-ciphertext attacks
\end{itemize}

How can we fix these flaws? One approach is to nondeterministically preprocess the message before encrypting it with RSA. One scheme is Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) [BR94]:

Theorem: OAEP is \textit{semantically secure} when H, G are \textit{random oracles}. Semantic security means that no partial information (other than the length of the message) is revealed by the ciphertext. The security holds under chosen-plaintext attacks and, when OAEP is used with RSA, under chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA1) also. 

The padding bits $010\cdots 0$ make OAEP secure against
